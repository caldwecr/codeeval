 * This method finds the combined area of two rectangles having edges parallel to the x-axis and the y-axis
 * of a cartesian plot. When the rectangles have an overlapping section the overlapping area should only be counted one time
 *
 * The problem (as I remember it) required a constant time and space solution
 *
 * Description of the solution
 *  - There are four possible scenarios in this approach
 * 1. The rectangles do not intersect
 * 2. One vertex of each rectangle is contained inside the other rectangle
 * 3. Two verticies of one rectange are contained in the other rectangle
 * 4. One rectangle is entirely contained by the other rectangle
 *
 * We can figure out which scenario by counting the number of vertices (points) contained in each rectangle
 *
